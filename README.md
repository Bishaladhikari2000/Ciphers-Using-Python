# Ciphers-Using-Python
Adopting innovative cipher algorithms using Python.


## Cipher
--> It is generally described as an implementation of the Encryption Algorithm to protect our data from hackers.

We are going to discuss about the following ciphers here:
* Ceaser Cipher
* Monoalphabetic Cipher

### Ceaser Cipher
-->  Ceaser Cipher is one of the oldest, and the first cipher introduced. This cipher works on the basic principle of substitution. Here, each letter in plain text is shifted        to a certain number of places.






Here, k = shifting key
      x = character to be encrypted or decrypted.
      
**Problem with Ceaser Cipher:**  As there is use of 26 possible keys, these keys can be easily cracked by hackers.

### Monoalphabetic Cipher
--> Monoalphabetic cipher is one where each symbol in plain text is mapped to a fixed symbol in cipher text.
    
Probability: 26! = 4 * 10^26
